## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Caden**, currently a Junior at the University of Minnesota studying **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. I love combining CS & Math to create interesting solutions to computational problems and explore new ideas â€” to me, CS feels like a specialized extension of Math with endless potential!

### ðŸ”­ What I'm Working On
- **Exploring**: Algorithms, cryptography, and data structures
- **Building**: Interactive web projects and data-driven applications
- **Learning**: Machine learning techniques, computational theory

### ðŸŒ± My Goals
Iâ€™m always eager to connect and hear new perspectives! Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat about projects, ideas, or potential collaborations.
